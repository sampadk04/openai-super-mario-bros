# openai-super-mario-bros

A Reinforcement Learning implementation on the OpenAI Gym environment setup for Super Mario Bros using the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Algorithm.

- We use OpenAI gym environment setup for Super Mario Bros to train a Reinforcement Learning Model using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm.
- We follow the steps below: 
    - preprocessing the enviroment
    - simplifying the movements for easier learning
    - grayscaling frames to reduce computation
    - vectorizing and stacking environments to keep track of multiple frames
