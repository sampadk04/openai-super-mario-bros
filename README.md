# OpenAI Super Mario Bros

A Reinforcement Learning implementation in the OpenAI Gym environment for Super Mario Bros, using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.

## Overview

This project leverages the OpenAI Gym environment to train a reinforcement learning model to play Super Mario Bros. The PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm is utilized to optimize the model's performance.

## Key Features

- **Preprocessing the Environment:** Preparing the Super Mario Bros environment for efficient training.
- **Simplified Movements:** Reducing the complexity of Mario's movements to facilitate easier learning.
- **Grayscale Frames:** Converting frames to grayscale to decrease computational load.
- **Vectorizing and Stacking Environments:** Managing multiple frames simultaneously to enhance tracking and decision-making.
